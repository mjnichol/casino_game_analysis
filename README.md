casino_game_analysis:
============================

This directory contains the code that I wrote in order to statistically analyze a casino table game that my friends created. I was submitted the rules of the game and I estimated the casino's house edge. The game was found to be out of wack so I am writing a program that will fit the payouts to obtain the desired house edge of 5%.
